* Matrices and Elimination
** Meaning of Matrices
The basic problem os linear algebra is to solve a system of linear equations,
for example, terms without exponentials, or logarithms. The matrix-form is one
way to represent a set of linear equations - a bunch of numbers organized in
squared form: 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{l}
    1x - 2y = -3   \\
    8x - 4y = 0
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

The system of linear equations above, could be also written in the matrix form
$A\textbf{x} = b$. This form, \(A\textbf{x}=b\), where \(A\) is capitalized
as it represents a $n x m$ matrix, and \(\textbf{x}\) and \(b\). The vector
of unknown variables \(\textbf{x}\) is bold, if a solution for the system is
found we could just write \(x\).

\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 \\
8 & -4
\end{bmatrix}
%
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Simmilarly we could have expressed the same expression in the following
matrix form:

\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
8
\end{bmatrix}
x +
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\
-4
\end{bmatrix}
y =
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

This can be also seen as the linear combination of the columns in the sense
of which two number $x$ and $y$ solve the system of equations so that the
the first row and the second row satisfy the equation, we can see for
instance that $x=1, y=2$ is a solution for this $\textbf{A} x = b$
matrix equation at some point \(x = \{1, 2\}\):

Notice that these system of equations are two lines in the 2 dimensional
space. There is a solution if the two lines meet, otherwise, if the
lines are parallel to each other, there will be no solution. It could
also be the case that these lines won't ever cross, if they are
parallel to each other, in this case, there would be no solution
for \(\textbf{x}\). Moreover, these could also be on top of each
other, meaning there would be infinite solutions \(x\)
for \(\textbf{x}\), or points along the line. 

Now, it's pretty clear, by eyeballing the rows that the point \((1,2)\)
solves the equation. We can also see this relationship in the plot
bellow:

We can notice that by adding one of column 1 with two of column 2 we get to
the vector. We can say that there is a linear combination of columns 1 and 2
that satisfies the equation, and by linear combination we mean that there are values
for \(x\)  and \(y\)  that satisfy the equation, moreover, we mean that we can
combine column 1 and column 2 in such a way to reach the vector as in the picture
above.
